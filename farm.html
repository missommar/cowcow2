      <h3><em>Farm</em></h3>
      <div class="links">
        <p> <em>Biodiversity</em> in the form of animal and plant species, rich microlife, closed nutrient cycles and pasture-based animal husbandry is the basis of how we strive to manage our farm and land.<br>
          We have approx. 60 hectares of land, the greater part of which is arable land with meadow-like dykes, pasture dykes and cultural cereals in perennial bottom crops. We grow vegetables for self-sufficiency and sometimes sell the surplus to neighbors or people passing by.<br>
          Here on the farm there are mountain cows, Helsinge sheep and just over 100 chickens. Over the past year, we have invested in predator fences on our pasture land in order to secure a long-term perspective in our ambition to improve the land's soil structure through rotational grazing. For this project we have had the pleasure of receiving support from the <em>European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development</em>.<br>
